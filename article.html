            <h2>Streamlining Campus Security: ID Scanning for CTU Students</h2>
            <p class="author">By Rodel Sumalinog | Published on 12/01/24</p>
            <p>Cebu Technological University (Danao Campus) has introduced an efficient and secure system for managing student entry and 
             exit from the campus. The newly implemented ID scanning process not only enhances security but also simplifies 
             record-keeping for both students and administrators.
          
            </p>Upon arriving at any CTU campus, students are required to scan their ID cards at the designated scanners located 
            at the entrance. This process records their log-in time in the system. Similarly, students must scan their ID again 
            when leaving the campus to register their log-out time.The system operates in real time, providing the university with 
            accurate data on campus occupancy and ensuring that only authorized individuals have access.
